Description
-----------

This app serves as a useful resource for analysis of the rental property market, in this capacity it provides access to three types of user, each for their own purposes:

 **Tenants**
 
 Tenants can use the app to search for available properties and to get information on these such as rental rates, location, number of bedrooms, etc. This serves as a useful reference for tenants who can compare rental rates - among other attributes â€“ between properties. Additionally a tenant can switch or terminate their registered residency, any updates are visible to all users.
 ---------
 **Landlords**
 
 The app serves as a location where landlords can register their properties, to this end it is useful for landlords advertising vacant properties as they are visible to prospective tenants. The landlord also has the ability to get a report on the different properties in an area detailing the kinds of properties and their rates. This allows the landlord to adjust their rates according to the current market, which can also be dome on the app. As with the tenant, any changes made are visible to other users.
 --------------
 **Administrators**
 
 Administrators have the highest level of access, they can add new (or delete) tenants and landlords. They also can see which tenant lives where (this is not visible to tenants or landlords) and the total income of each landlord. To easily view this data an administrator can sort the portfolio of residences according to a residence's attribute, also they have access to a visual chart of all the registered rental income which is divided according to each landlord's share. As the administrator has no direct access to the properties, they have no permissions to modify to the data stored on them.

The app was developed using the Play MVC framework version 1.4.1 and the Eclipse IDE.
