		<p>The 2004 Residential Tenancies act gives every landlord and
			tenant a right to a rent review once each year.</p>
		<p>The Act makes it illegal for a landlord to charge a rent higher
			than the market rent. If there is a dispute about the market rent,
			either the landlord or the tenant can take a case to the Private
			Residential Tenancies Board (the PTRB). The problem with this system
			is in establishing an objective way of determining the market rent of
			a property.</p>
		<p>The purpose of myrent is to gather information on rents from
			landlords and tenants and allow any registered user to generate a
			report on the state of the rental market. The success of the project
			will depend on the willingness of tenants and landlords to provide
			information about their properties.</p>
		<p>Log in or create a new account and input your details on the
			Input Data page. To provide the required information will take just a
			few minutes of your time.</p>
